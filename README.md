Scramjet is a simple reactive stream programming framework. The code is written by chaining functions that transform the streamed data, including well known map, filter and reduce.

The main advantage of Scramjet is running asynchronous operations on your data streams concurrently. It allows you to perform the transformations both synchronously and asynchronously by using the same API - so now you can "map" your stream from whatever source and call any number of API's consecutively.

[Originally written](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet) on top of node.js
object streams, Scramjet is now being ported into C++. This is what is
happening in this repository. There is also [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://github.com/scramjetorg/framework-js) and [Python](https://github.com/scramjetorg/framework-python) version available.

**We are open to your feedback!** We encourage you to report issues with any ideas, suggestions and features you would like to see in this version. You can also upvote (`+1`) existing ones to show us the direction we should take in developing Scramjet Framework.

## Requesting Features

Anything missing? Or maybe there is something which would make using Scramjet Framework much easier or efficient? Don't hesitate to fill up a [new feature request](https://github.com/scramjetorg/framework-cpp/issues/new)! We really appreciate all feedback.

## Reporting bugs

If you have found a bug, inconsistent or confusing behavior please fill up a [new bug report](https://github.com/scramjetorg/framework-cpp/issues/new).

## Contributing

You can contribute to this project by giving us feedback ([reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs) and [requesting features](#reporting-features)) and also by writing code yourself!

The easiest way is to [create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of this repository and then [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) with all your changes. In most cases, you should branch from and target `main` branch.

Please refer to [Development Setup](#development-setup) section on how to setup this project.

## Development Setup

// TBD (below previous setup instructions)

### Adjust the template to your needs

- Use this repo [as a template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
- Replace all occurrences of "Greeter" in the relevant CMakeLists.txt with the name of your project
  - Capitalization matters here: `Greeter` means the name of the project, while `greeter` is used in file names.
  - Remember to rename the `include/greeter` directory to use your project's lowercase name and update all relevant `#include`s accordingly.
- Replace the source files with your own
- For header-only libraries: see the comments in [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt)
- Add [your project's codecov token](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/quick-start) to your project's github secrets under `CODECOV_TOKEN`
- Happy coding!

Eventually, you can remove any unused files, such as the standalone directory or irrelevant github workflows for your project.
Feel free to replace the License with one suited for your project.

To cleanly separate the library and subproject code, the outer `CMakeList.txt` only defines the library itself while the tests and other subprojects are self-contained in their own directories.
During development it is usually convenient to [build all subprojects at once](#build-everything-at-once).

### Build and run the standalone target

Use the following command to build the library.

```bash
cmake -B build/
cmake --clean-first --build build
```

### Install C++17 and other prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt install gcc-10 gcc-10-base gcc-10-doc g++-10 libstdc++-10-dev libstdc++-10-doc
sudo apt install gdb gdb-doc
```

### Build and run test suite

Use the following commands from the project's root directory to run the test suite.

```bash
cmake -S test -B build/test
cmake --build build/test
CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 cmake --build build/test --target test

# or simply call the executable:
./build/test/GreeterTests
```

To collect code coverage information, run CMake with the `-DENABLE_TEST_COVERAGE=1` option.

### Run clang-format

Use the following commands from the project's root directory to check and fix C++ and CMake source style.
This requires _clang-format_, _cmake-format_ and _pyyaml_ to be installed on the current system.

```bash
cmake -S test -B build/test

# view changes
cmake --build build/test --target format

# apply changes
cmake --build build/test --target fix-format
```

See [Format.cmake](https://github.com/TheLartians/Format.cmake) for details.

### Build the documentation

The documentation is automatically built and [published](https://thelartians.github.io/ModernCppStarter) whenever a [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository) is created.
To manually build documentation, call the following command.

```bash
cmake -S documentation -B build/doc
cmake --build build/doc --target GenerateDocs
# view the docs
open build/doc/doxygen/html/index.html
```

To build the documentation locally, you will need Doxygen, jinja2 and Pygments on installed your system.

### Build everything at once

The project also includes an `all` directory that allows building all targets at the same time.
This is useful during development, as it exposes all subprojects to your IDE and avoids redundant builds of the library.

```bash
cmake -S all -B build
cmake --build build

# run tests
./build/test/IFCATests
# format code
cmake --build build --target fix-format
# build docs
cmake --build build --target GenerateDocs
```

### Additional tools

The test and standalone subprojects include the [tools.cmake](cmake/tools.cmake) file which is used to import additional tools on-demand through CMake configuration arguments.
The following are currently supported.

#### Sanitizers

Sanitizers can be enabled by configuring CMake with `-DUSE_SANITIZER=<Address | Memory | MemoryWithOrigins | Undefined | Thread | Leak | 'Address;Undefined'>`.

#### Static Analyzers

Static Analyzers can be enabled by setting `-DUSE_STATIC_ANALYZER=<clang-tidy | iwyu | cppcheck>`, or a combination of those in quotation marks, separated by semicolons.
By default, analyzers will automatically find configuration files such as `.clang-format`.
Additional arguments can be passed to the analyzers by setting the `CLANG_TIDY_ARGS`, `IWYU_ARGS` or `CPPCHECK_ARGS` variables.

#### Ccache

Ccache can be enabled by configuring with `-DUSE_CCACHE=<ON | OFF>`.

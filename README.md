Scramjet is a simple reactive stream programming framework. The code is written by chaining functions that transform the streamed data, including well known map, filter and reduce.

The main advantage of Scramjet is running asynchronous operations on your data streams concurrently. It allows you to perform the transformations both synchronously and asynchronously by using the same API - so now you can "map" your stream from whatever source and call any number of API's consecutively.

[Originally written](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet) on top of node.js
object streams, Scramjet is now being ported into C++. This is what is
happening in this repository. There is also [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://github.com/scramjetorg/framework-js) and [Python](https://github.com/scramjetorg/framework-python) version available.

**We are open to your feedback!** We encourage you to report issues with any ideas, suggestions and features you would like to see in this version. You can also upvote (`+1`) existing ones to show us the direction we should take in developing Scramjet Framework.

## Contributing

You can contribute to this project by giving us feedback ([reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs) and [requesting features](#reporting-features)) and also by writing code yourself!

The easiest way is to [create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of this repository and then [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) with all your changes. In most cases, you should branch from and target `main` branch.

Please refer to [Development Setup](#development-setup) section on how to setup this project.

## Development Setup

1\. Clone this repo:

```bash
git@github.com:scramjetorg/framework-cpp.git
```

2\. List presets available on your OS:

```bash
cmake --list-presets=all .
```

It will result with a similar list:

```bash
Available configure presets:

  "linux-debug"         - Linux Debug
  "linux-test-coverage" - Linux Test Coverage
  "linux-release"       - Linux Release
```

3\. Build `make` according to specific preset:

```bash
cmake --preset linux-debug
```

4\. Build project using `make` file from previous step:

```bash
cd out/build/linux-debug/
cmake --build .
```

5\. Run tests (only debug presets)

```bash
./tests/IFCA_tests
```
